          <p>Some Progress!</p>
          
          <p>Remember how in my earlier post <a class="link" href="https://dorindabassey.github.io/post4.html", style="color:blue;">here</a>, I complained about a certain task I was stuck on, well the rubber duck programming method worked.</p>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/debuginfo_2x.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <p>I was expected to verify that running debuginfod manually and setting DEBUGINFOD_URLS works, but when I tried to test the debuginfod server I setup by fetching debuginfo symbols for some Yocto binaries built with an image in Yocto, I was getting "server query failed: no such file or directory" meaning that the debuginfo symbols weren't on the server that I was running. I kept wondering what could be the problem, only for me to find out with help from the elfutils community that while I was running my local debuginfod server, I set the server to fetch symbols of .ipk binaries whereas I was searching for symbols of .rpm binaries and vice-versa I was doing same for .ipk files such that; when i set the server to run .rpm binaries, I go ahead to search the server for .ipk binaries. This was me confusing myself and running in cycles, unknown to me that I was looking up the right binaries on the wrong server. This was clearly an oversight on my part and it did cost me a great amount of wasted time, however I've learned from my mistakes, and now I completely understand the concept of implementing debuginfod.</p>
          
          <p>I am excited about this week, I'll tell you the whys, first reason which you just recently read a minute ago, second reason is that i just learned that a new version of elfutils - elfutils 0.183 will be released next week, and one of the contributions I made with the help of my mentor Ross has been merged pending next week release. trivial the patch might be but it did make a great deal to me that I was part of a community contributing to the next release of elfutils software.</p>
          
          <p>Yes, i saved the most interesting part of my week for the last.</p>
          <p>This past week, I've been making some mini contributions to The Yocto Project, and the community members have been very helpful and resourceful, I must say that this past week I've learnt a great deal about The Yocto Project, more about git navigation and open source contribution, at least I can proudly say I have overcome my fear of git rebasing, squashing, and splitting commits.</p>

          <p>That's all for now, although writing this piece gave me new ideas, so I have a list of upcoming blog posts. I might as well highlight them now lest I forget :)</p>
          <p>- How to setup a debuginfod server and fetch debug symbols for a Yocto build system. perks(this would save you some space as debuginfo resources are known to be 3 to 5 times larger than your executable)</p>
          <p>- My Career goals and opportunities. (I'm already getting the jitters)</p>
          <p>- I wrote about how to change Linux kernel version, it's about time i make a post on it. Well now that i have a better grasp of the Yocto Project, embarrassing to say but during my initial contribution stage on Outreachy, I remember trying to fix a bug which was about "writing how to change kernel version for a Yocto Image", and in my appalling na√Øvety I wrote about how to change Linux kernel version. Looking back now I can't help laughing at myself.</p>
          <p>Thank you for stopping by, If you enjoyed this post expect more then.</p>
